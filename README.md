# finance

I started this project to get a grip on my personal finances and be better organised with it.
Since no one did what I wanted, I wrote a program for it myself.
In Web-Development I had the most skin, so I ended up realizing my ideas with a website.
This site could read .CSVs from my bank, link those transactions to categories according to preset keywords in the paymemt details and generate a detailed financial statement as PDF.
I used to print this every month and tweak my expenses on that. It was really helpful.
The problem was, that it was really tideous to log into every bank, download a CSV for every account. Also the links were not always made.
This lead me to stop using and developing it further.

In the following I want to gather ideas for future development.
